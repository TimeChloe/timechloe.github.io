I am a master's student at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), specializing in **Mechatronics and Robotics** as well as **Medical Technology and Assistance Systems**. I received my bachelor's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020.  

Currently, I am completing my **master’s thesis** at the [AIR Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Real-Time Systems](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/air/) at TUM, under the guidance of [Kejia Chen](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/air/people/kejia-chen-msc/) and supervised by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Alois Knoll](https://www.professoren.tum.de/knoll-alois-christian) and [Prof. Dr. Sami Haddadin](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/sami-haddadin/). 
Previously, I completed my **master’s semester thesis** at [KI.Fabrik](https://kifabrik.mirmi.tum.de/), part of the [Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI)](https://www.mirmi.tum.de/).

In parallel, I work as a **student research assistant** at the [Chair of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/cps/).


My research interests include **robot manipulation**, **teleoperation**, **collaborative robot control systems**, and **deformable object manipulation**. I am particularly fascinated by the design and control strategies that enable robots to interact safely and efficiently with humans and dynamic environments. Now, I focus on developing control frameworks and perception methods for the real-time manipulation of **deformable linear objects (DLOs)**, such as cables, ropes, or surgical threads, which present significant challenges due to their high-dimensional dynamic.
