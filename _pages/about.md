I am a master's student at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), specializing in **Mechatronics and Robotics** as well as **Medical Technology and Assistance Systems**. I received my bachelor's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020.  

Currently, I am a student research assistant at the **AIR Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Real-Time Systems** at TUM. I completed my **master’s semester thesis** at **KI.Fabrik**, part of the [Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI)](https://www.mirmi.tum.de/). I am very fortunate to be advised by **Kejia Chen**, under the supervision of **Prof. Dr.-Ing. Alois Knoll** and **Prof. Dr. Sami Haddadin**.  

My research interests include **robotic manipulation**, **teleoperation**, and **collaborative robot control systems**. I am particularly fascinated by the design and control strategies that enable robots to interact safely and efficiently with humans and dynamic environments.  

Currently, I am exploring potential topics for my **master’s thesis**, particularly in the field of **collaborative robotics**. I am eager to engage in research that contributes to improving robot autonomy, safety, and adaptability in human-robot collaboration scenarios. If you have exciting research ideas or potential collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out!
